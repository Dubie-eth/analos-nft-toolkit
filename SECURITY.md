## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

When using this toolkit:

### **Environment Variables**
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Use `.env.example` templates
- ✅ Rotate keys regularly
- ✅ Use different keys for dev/prod

### **Smart Contracts**
- ✅ Audit before mainnet deployment
- ✅ Test on devnet first
- ✅ Use established patterns
- ✅ Implement proper access controls

### **Database**
- ✅ Enable Row-Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Use service role keys server-side only
- ✅ Validate all inputs
- ✅ Sanitize user data

### **API Routes**
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Verify signatures server-side
- ✅ Use CORS properly
- ✅ Handle errors securely
